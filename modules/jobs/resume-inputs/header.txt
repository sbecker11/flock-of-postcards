As a senior data engineer with growing machine learning expertise, I aim to apply my extensive data management skills to the rising field of ML and MLOps. My background includes creating scalable, secure data pipelines and robust infrastructures across industries like entertainment, healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. Leveraging AWS-based solutions, I excel in problem-solving and cross-functional collaboration, using Agile methods to deliver working increments of well-architected solutions that satisfy product stakeholders. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects combining traditional data engineering with advanced machine learning operations, to share the excitement of working with cutting-edge technologies that provide real-world value.
